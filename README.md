# Airbnb_User_Analysis
data source:Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data
This analysis mainly involves four parts:

## User Profile
**Through data visualization, it can be found that:**
1.There is no big gender difference.
2.Users are mainly in age group 23-36, followed by age group 37-45. It is also worth noting that there is a big gender difference in age group 23-29 with more women using Airbnb.
3.It can be seen that users are widely distributed based on language, but English is the dominant language. Chinese is also active.
4.US is the most popular countries. Next came France and Italy.
5.As for the device used, users mainly use desktop, with more using Mac; Similarly, more people use iPhone and iPad than Android Phone.
### Suggestions:
1.Based on gender, age and destination, we can target users through appropriate advertising and promotion. For example, for the most active age group 23-29, we can further analyse their characteristics, such as job, salary range, travel budget and plan, travel habits and other behaviors to determine the content of advertisement, where to put it and how to encourage them to share more.
2.It is good to see Airbnb is used worldwide, but the markets aside from English markets are still needed to explore. China as an emerging market can be referred to when expanding developing countries.
3.It is worth exploring why users prefer desktop rather than smart phones which is much more convenient. One possible reason can be that it is much more clear to check out details of the accomodation/easier to talk with hosts. A survey can be done to make it clear and followed improvements can be made on the app.
4.Facebook is a popular method to sign up and this may be due to 1. it is easier to sign up 2.Users get to know Airbnb from Facebook. Therefore, it is worth making full use of Facebook by encouraging sharing/advertising etc.


## User growth during the given period (2010-2014)
1.The number of users kept increasing. More specifially, there was a slight increase in 2011 and a more considerable rise can be found in 2012 and 2013. The year 2014 witnessed a dramatic increase.
2.There was a noticeable climb each year, normally starting from July and ending in October.

### Suggestions
1.Further investigation on business activities in each year can be done to see what works for business growth. 2.The growth can also be divided into different countries. 3.As for the climb each year, the possible reason is that people tend to travel during summer. Therefore, there can be some advertisement, marketing and promotion to target those users.

## Channel Analysis 
**Through visualization and calculation, we can compare traffic and conversion rate of different channels** 
1.Biggest traffic came from direct, but it's also worh noting that SEM-Brand from Google and SEM-Non-Brand from Google as well as SEO from Google also contributed to the traffic, and their conversion rate was similar, at around 30%.

2.Channels with less vists but high conversion rate: other_craigslist,sem-non-brand from bing, other from padmapper, sem-non-brand-vast and sem-brand & sem-non-brand from baidu.

### Suggestions
1.It is no surpring that Google contributed a lot to traffic since it was leading search engine. With a good conversion rate in SEM-brand,SEM-non Brand and SEO, they should be configured to maxmize ROI. And it is also to be noted that the content from Google was just 14%.

2.We also need to pay attention to other providers and channels, especially those specific to an area, such as in China, Baidu is the source and craigslist is popular among new yorkers.

## Funnel Analysis
**Through a funnel, we can easily spot where the conversion rate is high or low to analyze retention and loss**
1.The biggest loss was the conversion from signup to booking. 
2.Most people would pay after they booked. 
3.Repay rate was relatively high, almost 50%. 

### Suggestions 
1.Further user behavior analysis should be done to find why users did not pay. This can be analyzed by their action and elaspsed time. 
2.We should find why payment was not completed and see whether it has something to do with our product or the process. 
3.We can invite those who paid more than twice to share their stories via different channels and maybe use coupon as an incentive.
